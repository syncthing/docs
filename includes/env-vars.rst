STTRACE
    Used to increase the debugging verbosity in specific facilities,
    generally mapping to a Go package. Enter a comma-separated string of
    facilities to trace: ``api,beacon``. Optionally, a log level can be
    given per facility to specify something other than DEBUG:
    ``api:WARN,beacon:ERR``, potentially overriding a global ``--log-level``
    adjustment.

     The valid facility strings are listed below; additionally, ``syncthing
     serve --help`` always outputs the most up-to-date list.

        api             - REST API
        beacon          - Multicast and broadcast discovery
        config          - Configuration loading and saving
        connections     - Connection handling
        db/sqlite       - SQLite database
        dialer          - Dialing connections
        discover        - Remote device discovery
        events          - Event generation and logging
        fs              - Filesystem access
        main            - Main package
        model           - The root hub
        nat             - NAT discovery and port mapping
        pmp             - NAT-PMP discovery and port mapping
        protocol        - The BEP protocol
        relay/client    - Relay client
        scanner         - File change detection and hashing
        stun            - STUN functionality
        syncthing       - Main run facility
        upgrade         - Binary upgrades
        upnp            - UPnP discovery and port mapping
        ur              - Usage reporting
        versioner       - File versioning
        watchaggregator - Filesystem event watcher

STLOCKTHRESHOLD
    Used for debugging internal deadlocks; sets debug sensitivity. Use only
    under direction of a developer.

STVERSIONEXTRA
    Add extra information to the version string in logs and the version line
    in the GUI. Can be set to the name of a wrapper or tool controlling
    syncthing to communicate this to the end user.

GOMAXPROCS
    Set the maximum number of CPU cores to use. Defaults to all available CPU
    cores.

GOGC
    Percentage of heap growth at which to trigger GC. Default is 100. Lower
    numbers keep peak memory usage down, at the price of CPU usage
    (i.e. performance).

LOGGER_DISCARD
    Hack to completely disable logging, for example when running benchmarks.
    Set to any nonempty value to use it.
