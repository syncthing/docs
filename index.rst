Welcome to Syncthing's documentation!
=====================================

As a new user, the :ref:`getting started guide <getting-started>` is a good
place to start, then perhaps moving on to :ref:`the FAQ <faq>`. If you run
into trouble getting devices to connect to each other, the page about
:ref:`firewall setup <firewall-setup>` explains the networking necessary to
get it to work.

As a developer looking to get started with a contribution, see :ref:`how to
build <building>`, :ref:`how to debug <debugging>` and the `contribution
guidelines`_. This documentation site can be edited on Github_.
