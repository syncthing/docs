Ignoring Files
==============

Synopsis
--------

::

    .stignore

Description
-----------

If some files should not be synchronized to (or from) other devices, a file called
``.stignore`` can be created containing file patterns to ignore. The
``.stignore`` file must be placed in the root of the folder. The
``.stignore`` file itself will never be synced to other devices, although it can
``#include`` files that *are* synchronized between devices. All patterns are
relative to the folder root.
The contents of the ``.stignore`` file must be UTF-8 encoded.

.. note::

    Note that ignored files can block removal of an otherwise empty directory.
    See below for the (?d) prefix to allow deletion of ignored files.

Patterns
--------

The ``.stignore`` file contains a list of file or path patterns. The
*first* pattern that matches will decide the fate of a given file.

-  Regular file names match themselves, i.e. the pattern ``foo`` matches
   the files ``foo``, ``subdir/foo`` as well as any directory named
   ``foo``. Spaces are treated as regular characters, except for leading
   and trailing spaces, which are automatically trimmed.

-  **Asterisk** (``*``) matches zero or more characters in a filename, but does not
   match the directory separator. ``te*ne`` matches ``telephone``,
   ``subdir/telephone`` but not ``tele/phone``.

-  **Double asterisk** (``**``) matches as above, but also directory separators.
   ``te**ne`` matches ``telephone``, ``subdir/telephone`` and
   ``tele/sub/dir/phone``.

-  **Question mark** (``?``) matches a single character that is not the directory
   separator. ``te??st`` matches ``tebest`` but not ``teb/st`` or
   ``test``.

-  **Square brackets** (``[]``) denote a character range: ``[a-z]`` matches
   any lower case character.

-  **Curly brackets** (``{}``) denote a set of comma separated alternatives:
   ``{banana,pineapple}`` matches either ``banana`` or ``pineapple``.

-  **Backslash** (``\``) "escapes" a special character so that it loses its
   special meaning. For example, ``\{banana\}`` matches ``{banana}`` exactly
   and does not denote a set of alternatives as above.

.. note::

   Escaped characters are not supported on Windows, where ``\`` is the
   path separator. If you still need to match files that have square or
   curly brackets in their names, one possible workaround is to replace
   them with ``?``, which will then match any character. For example,
   you can type ``?banana?`` to match both ``[banana]`` and
   ``{banana}``, and so on.

-  A pattern beginning with ``/`` matches in the root of the folder only.
   ``/foo`` matches ``foo`` but not ``subdir/foo``.

-  A pattern beginning with ``#include`` results in loading patterns
   from the named file. It is an error for a file to not exist or be
   included more than once. Note that while this can be used to include
   patterns from a file in a subdirectory, the patterns themselves are
   still relative to the folder *root*. Example:
   ``#include more-patterns.txt``.

-  A pattern beginning with a ``!`` prefix negates the pattern: matching files
   are *included* (that is, *not* ignored). This can be used to override
   more general patterns that follow.

-  A pattern beginning with a ``(?i)`` prefix enables case-insensitive pattern
   matching. ``(?i)test`` matches ``test``, ``TEST`` and ``tEsT``. The
   ``(?i)`` prefix can be combined with other patterns, for example the
   pattern ``(?i)!picture*.png`` indicates that ``Picture1.PNG`` should
   be synchronized. On Mac OS and Windows, patterns are always case-insensitive.

-  A pattern beginning with a ``(?d)`` prefix enables removal of these files if
   they are preventing directory deletion. This prefix should be used by any OS
   generated files which you are happy to be removed.

-  A line beginning with ``//`` is a comment and has no effect.

.. note::

   Prefixes can be specified in any order (e.g. "(?d)(?i)"), but cannot be in a
   single pair of parentheses (not ":strike:`(?di)`").

.. note::

   Include patterns (that begin with ``!``) cause Syncthing to traverse 
   the entire directory tree regardless of other ignore patterns. 
   If the :ref:`watcher <scanning>` is enabled, the entire directory 
   tree will be watched as well.

   Top-level include patterns are treated as special cases and will not force Syncthing to
   scan (or watch) the entire directory tree. For example: ``!/foo`` is a top-level include
   pattern, while ``!/foo/bar`` is not.

Example
-------

Given a directory layout::

    .DS_Store
    foo
    foofoo
    bar/
        baz
        quux
        quuz
    bar2/
        baz
        frobble
    My Pictures/
        Img15.PNG

and an ``.stignore`` file with the contents::

    (?d).DS_Store
    !frobble
    !quuz
    foo
    *2
    qu*
    (?i)my pictures

all files and directories called "foo", ending in a "2" or starting with
"qu" will be ignored. The end result becomes::

    .DS_Store     # ignored, will be deleted if gets in the way of parent directory removal
    foo           # ignored, matches "foo"
    foofoo        # synced, does not match "foo" but would match "foo*" or "*foo"
    bar/          # synced
        baz       # synced
        quux      # ignored, matches "qu*"
        quuz      # synced, matches "qu*" but is excluded by the preceding "!quuz"
    bar2/         # synced, despite matching "*2" due to child frobble
        baz       # ignored, due to parent being ignored
        frobble   # synced, due to "!frobble"
    My Pictures/  # ignored, matched case insensitive "(?i)my pictures" pattern
        Img15.PNG # ignored, due to parent being ignored

.. note::
  Please note that directory patterns ending with a slash
  ``some/directory/`` matches the content of the directory, but not the
  directory itself. If you want the pattern to match the directory and its
  content, make sure it does not have a ``/`` at the end of the pattern.
