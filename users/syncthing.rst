Description
-----------

Syncthing lets you synchronize your files bidirectionally across multiple
devices. This means the creation, modification or deletion of files on one
machine will automatically be replicated to your other devices. We believe your
data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored. Therefore
Syncthing does not upload your data to the cloud but exchanges your data across
your machines as soon as they are online at the same time.

Options
-------

.. cmdoption:: -audit

    Write events to timestamped file ``audit-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log``.

.. cmdoption:: -auditfile=<file|-|-->

    Use specified file or stream (``"-"`` for stdout, ``"--"`` for stderr) for
    audit events, rather than the timestamped default file name.

.. cmdoption:: -browser-only

   Open the web UI in a browser for an already running Syncthing instance.

.. cmdoption:: -device-id

   Print device ID to command line.

.. cmdoption:: -generate=<dir>

    Generate key and config in specified dir, then exit.

.. cmdoption:: -gui-address=<address>

    Override GUI listen address. Set this to an address (``0.0.0.0:8384``)
    or file path (``/var/run/st.sock``, for UNIX sockets).

.. cmdoption:: -home=<dir>

    Set common configuration and data directory. The default configuration
    directory is ``$HOME/.config/syncthing`` (Unix-like),
    ``$HOME/Library/Application Support/Syncthing`` (Mac) and
    ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\Syncthing`` (Windows).

.. cmdoption:: -config=<dir>

    Set configuration directory. Alternative to ``-home`` and must be used
    together with ``-data``.

.. cmdoption:: -data=<dir>

    Set data (e.g. database) directory. Alternative to ``-home`` and must be used
    together with ``-config``.

.. cmdoption:: -logfile=<filename>

    Set destination filename for logging (use ``"-"`` for stdout, which is the
    default option).

.. cmdoption:: -logflags=<flags>

    Select information in log line prefix. The ``-logflags`` value is a sum of
    the following:

    -  1: Date
    -  2: Time
    -  4: Microsecond time
    -  8: Long filename
    - 16: Short filename

    To prefix each log line with date and time, set ``-logflags=3`` (1 + 2 from
    above). The value 0 is used to disable all of the above. The default is to
    show time only (2).

.. cmdoption:: -no-browser

    Do not start a browser.

.. cmdoption:: -no-console

    Hide the console window. (On Windows only)

.. cmdoption:: -no-restart

    Do not restart Syncthing when it exits. The monitor process will still run
    to handle crashes and writing to logfiles (if configured to).

.. cmdoption:: -paths

    Print the paths used for configuration, keys, database, GUI overrides,
    default sync folder and the log file.

.. cmdoption:: -paused

    Start with all devices and folders paused.

.. cmdoption:: -reset-database

    Reset the database, forcing a full rescan and resync. Create `.stfolder`
    folders in each sync folder if they do not already exist. **Caution**:
    Ensure that all sync folders which are mountpoints are already mounted.
    Inconsistent versions may result if the mountpoint is later mounted and
    contains older versions.

.. cmdoption:: -reset-deltas

    Reset delta index IDs, forcing a full index exchange.

.. cmdoption:: -unpaused

    Start with all devices and folders unpaused.

.. cmdoption:: -upgrade

    Perform upgrade.

.. cmdoption:: -upgrade-check

    Check for available upgrade.

.. cmdoption:: -upgrade-to=<url>

    Force upgrade directly from specified URL.

.. cmdoption:: -verbose

    Print verbose log output.

.. cmdoption:: -version

    Show version.

Exit Codes
----------

0
    Success / Shutdown
1
    Error
2
    Upgrade not available
3
    Restarting
4
    Upgrading

Exit codes over 125 are usually returned by the shell/binary loader/default
signal handler. Exit codes over 128+N on Unix usually represent the signal which
caused the process to exit. For example, ``128 + 9 (SIGKILL) = 137``.

Proxies
-------

Syncthing can use a SOCKS, HTTP, or HTTPS proxy to talk to the outside
world. The proxy is used for outgoing connections only - it is not possible
to accept incoming connections through the proxy. The proxy is configured
through the environment variable ``all_proxy``. Somewhat unusually, this
variable must be named in lower case - it is not ":strike:`ALL_PROXY`". For
example::

    $ export all_proxy=socks://192.0.2.42:8081

Development Settings
--------------------

The following environment variables modify Syncthing's behavior in ways that
are mostly useful for developers. Use with care.
If you start Syncthing from within service managers like systemd or supervisor,
path expansion may not be supported.

.. include:: ../includes/env-vars.rst
