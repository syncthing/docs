Description
-----------

Syncthing is an application that lets you synchronize your files across multiple
devices. This means the creation, modification or deletion of files on one
machine will automatically be replicated to your other devices. We believe your
data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored. Therefore
Syncthing does not upload your data to the cloud but exchanges your data across
your machines as soon as they are online at the same time.

Options
-------

.. cmdoption:: -audit

    Write events to timestamped file ``audit-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log``.

.. cmdoption:: -auditfile=<file|-|-->

    Use specified file or stream (``"-"`` for stdout, ``"--"`` for stderr) for audit events, rather than the timestamped default file name.

.. cmdoption:: -generate=<dir>

    Generate key and config in specified dir, then exit.

.. cmdoption:: -gui-address=<address>

    Override GUI listen address.

.. cmdoption:: -home=<dir>

    Set configuration directory. The default configuration directory is
    ``$HOME/.config/syncthing`` (Unix-like), ``$HOME/Library/Application Support/Syncthing`` (Mac) and ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\Syncthing`` (Windows).

.. cmdoption:: -logfile=<filename>

    Set destination filename for logging (use ``"-"`` for stdout, which is the default option).

.. cmdoption:: -logflags=<flags>

    Select information in log line prefix, default 2. The ``-logflags`` value is
    a sum of the following:

    -  1: Date
    -  2: Time
    -  4: Microsecond time
    -  8: Long filename
    - 16: Short filename

    To prefix each log line with date and time, set ``-logflags=3`` (1 + 2 from
    above). The value 0 is used to disable all of the above. The default is to
    show time only (2).

.. cmdoption:: -no-browser

    Do not start a browser.

.. cmdoption:: -no-console

    Hide the console window. (On Windows only)

.. cmdoption:: -no-restart

    Disable the Syncthing monitor process which handles restarts for some configuration changes, upgrades, crashes and also log file writing (stdout is still written).

.. cmdoption:: -paths

    Print the paths used for configuration, keys, database, GUI overrides, default sync folder and the log file.

.. cmdoption:: -reset-database

    Reset the database, forcing a full rescan and resync.
    Create `.stfolder` folders in each sync folder if they do not already exist. 
    **Caution**: Ensure that all sync folders which are mountpoints are already mounted. Inconsistent versions may result if the mountpoint is later mounted and contains older versions.


.. cmdoption:: -reset-deltas

    Reset delta index IDs, forcing a full index exchange.

.. cmdoption:: -upgrade

    Perform upgrade.

.. cmdoption:: -upgrade-check

    Check for available upgrade.

.. cmdoption:: -upgrade-to=<url>

    Force upgrade directly from specified URL.

.. cmdoption:: -verbose

    Print verbose log output.

.. cmdoption:: -version

    Show version.

Deprecated Options
------------------

.. cmdoption:: -gui-apikey=<key>

    Override GUI API key (deprecated as of v0.13, to be removed in the future - do not use).

Exit Codes
----------

0
    Success / Shutdown
1
    Error
2
    Upgrade not available
3
    Restarting
4
    Upgrading

Some of these exit codes are only returned when running without a monitor
process (with environment variable ``STNORESTART`` set). Exit codes over 125 are
usually returned by the shell/binary loader/default signal handler. Exit codes
over 128+N on Unix usually represent the signal which caused the process to
exit. For example, ``128 + 9 (SIGKILL) = 137``.

Development Settings
--------------------

The following environment variables modify Syncthing's behavior in ways that
are mostly useful for developers. Use with care.
If you start Syncthing from within service managers like systemd or supervisor,
path expansion may not be supported.

STNODEFAULTFOLDER
    Don't create a default folder when starting for the first time. This
    variable will be ignored anytime after the first run.
STGUIASSETS
    Directory to load GUI assets from. Overrides compiled in assets.
STTRACE
    Used to increase the debugging verbosity in specific or all facilities, generally mapping to a Go package. Enabling any of these also enables microsecond timestamps, file names plus line numbers. Enter a comma-separated string of facilities to trace. ``syncthing -help`` always outputs an up-to-date list. The valid facility strings
    are:

    Main and operational facilities:
        main
            Main package.
        model
            The root hub; the largest chunk of the system. File pulling, index transmission and requests for chunks.
        config
            Configuration loading and saving.
        db
            The database layer.
        scanner
            File change detection and hashing.
        versioner
            File versioning.

    Networking facilities:
        beacon
            Multicast and broadcast discovery packets.
        connections
            Connection handling.
        dialer
            Dialing connections.
        discover
            Remote device discovery requests, replies and registration of devices.
        relay
            Relay interaction.
        protocol
            The BEP protocol.
        nat
            NAT discovery and port mapping.
        pmp
            NAT-PMP discovery and port mapping.
        upnp
            UPnP discovery and port mapping.

    Other facilities:
        events
            Event generation and logging.
        http
           REST API.
        sha256
            SHA256 hashing package (this facility currently unused).
        stats
            Persistent device and folder statistics.
        sync
            Mutexes. Used for debugging race conditions and deadlocks.
        upgrade
            Binary upgrades.

        all
            All of the above.
STPROFILER
    Set to a listen address such as "127.0.0.1:9090" to start the profiler with
    HTTP access.
STCPUPROFILE
    Write a CPU profile to cpu-$pid.pprof on exit.
STHEAPPROFILE
    Write heap profiles to ``heap-$pid-$timestamp.pprof`` each time heap usage
    increases.
STBLOCKPROFILE
    Write block profiles to ``block-$pid-$timestamp.pprof`` every 20 seconds.
STPERFSTATS
    Write running performance statistics to ``perf-$pid.csv``. Not supported on
    Windows.
STDEADLOCK
    Used for debugging internal deadlocks. Use only under direction of a
    developer.
STDEADLOCKTIMEOUT
    Used for debugging internal deadlocks; sets debug sensitivity. Use only
    under direction of a developer.
STDEADLOCKTHRESHOLD
    Used for debugging internal deadlocks; sets debug sensitivity. Use only
    under direction of a developer.
STNORESTART
    Equivalent to the -no-restart argument. Disable the Syncthing monitor process which handles restarts for some configuration changes, upgrades, crashes and also log file writing (stdout is still written).
STNOUPGRADE
    Disable automatic upgrades.
STHASHING
    Specify which hashing package to use. Defaults to automatic based on
    performance. Specify "minio" (compatibility) or "standard" for the default Go implementation.
GOMAXPROCS
    Set the maximum number of CPU cores to use. Defaults to all available CPU
    cores.
GOGC
    Percentage of heap growth at which to trigger GC. Default is 100. Lower
    numbers keep peak memory usage down, at the price of CPU usage
    (i.e. performance).
