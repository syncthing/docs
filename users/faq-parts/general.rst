What is Syncthing?
------------------

Syncthing is an application that lets you synchronize your files across multiple
devices. This means the creation, modification or deletion of files on one
machine will automatically be replicated to your other devices. We believe your
data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored. Therefore
Syncthing does not upload your data to the cloud but exchanges your data across
your machines as soon as they are online at the same time.

Is it "syncthing", "Syncthing" or "SyncThing"?
----------------------------------------------

It's **Syncthing**, although the command and source repository is spelled
``syncthing`` so it may be referred to in that way as well. It's definitely not
:strike:`SyncThing`, even though the abbreviation ``st`` is used in some
circumstances and file names.

What things are synced?
-----------------------

The following things are *always* synchronized:

-  File contents
-  File modification times

The following may be synchronized or not, depending:

-  File permissions (when supported by file system; on Windows only the
   read only bit is synchronized)
-  Symbolic links (synced, except on Windows, but never followed)

The following are *not* synchronized;

-  File or directory owners and Groups (not preserved)
-  Directory modification times (not preserved)
-  Hard links (followed, not preserved)
-  Windows junctions (synced as ordinary directories; require enabling
   in the configuration on a per-folder basis)
-  Extended attributes, resource forks (not preserved)
-  Windows, POSIX or NFS ACLs (not preserved)
-  Devices, FIFOs, and other specials (ignored)
-  Sparse file sparseness (will become sparse, when supported by the OS & filesystem)

Is synchronization fast?
------------------------

Syncthing segments files into pieces, called blocks, to transfer data from one
device to another. Therefore, multiple devices can share the synchronization
load, in a similar way to the torrent protocol. The more devices you have online,
the faster an additional device will receive the data
because small blocks will be fetched from all devices in parallel.

Syncthing handles renaming files and updating their metadata in an efficient
manner. This means that renaming a file will not cause a retransmission of
that file. Additionally, appending data to existing files should be handled
efficiently as well.

:ref:`Temporary files <temporary-files>` are used to store partial data
downloaded from other devices. They are automatically removed whenever a file
transfer has been completed or after the configured amount of time which is set
in the configuration file (24 hours by default).

How does Syncthing differ from BitTorrent/Resilio Sync?
-------------------------------------------------------

The two are different and not related. Syncthing and BitTorrent/Resilio Sync accomplish
some of the same things, namely syncing files between two or more computers.

BitTorrent Sync, now called Resilio Sync, is a proprietary peer-to-peer file
synchronization tool available for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Windows
Phone, Amazon Kindle Fire and BSD. [#resiliosync]_ Syncthing is an open source file
synchronization tool.

Syncthing uses an open and documented protocol, and likewise the security
mechanisms in use are well defined and visible in the source code. Resilio
Sync uses an undocumented, closed protocol with unknown security properties.

Is there an iOS client?
-----------------------

There are no plans by the current Syncthing team to officially support iOS in the foreseeable future.

iOS has significant restrictions on background processing that make it very hard to
run Syncthing reliably and integrate it into the system.

However, there is a commercial packaging of Syncthing for iOS that attempts to work within these limitations. [#mobiussync]_

Should I keep my device IDs secret?
-----------------------------------

No. The IDs are not sensitive. Given a device ID it's possible to find the IP
address for that device, if global discovery is enabled on it. Knowing the device
ID doesn't help you actually establish a connection to that device or get a list
of files, etc.

For a connection to be established, both devices need to know about the other's
device ID. It's not possible (in practice) to forge a device ID. (To forge a
device ID you need to create a TLS certificate with that specific SHA-256 hash.
If you can do that, you can spoof any TLS certificate. The world is your
oyster!)
