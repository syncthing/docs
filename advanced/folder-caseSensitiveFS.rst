caseSensitiveFS
===============

.. versionadded:: 1.9.0

``caseSensitiveFS`` is an advanced folder setting that affects file name
handling. When set to ``true`` the extra safety checks for case insensitive
filesystems are disabled, reverting the behavior to that of Syncthing 1.8.0
and earlier. With the safety checks enabled (``caseSensitiveFS = false``,
the default) Syncthing will attempt to detect and prevent case-only file
name collisions that can occur on case insensitive systems such as Windows
and macOS, or other systems with case insensitive file systems.

.. note:: This option should normally be set to ``false``. It is
	  **not** meant to change the basic principles how Syncthing
	  :ref:`handles case-sensitivity <case-sensitivity>`, but only provides
	  a performance optimization when the underlying filesystem is
	  positively known to be case-sensitive already.
