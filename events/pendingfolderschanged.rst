PendingFoldersChanged
---------------------

.. versionadded:: 1.14.0

Emitted when pending folders were added / updated (offered by some
device, but not shared to them) or removed (folder ignored, dismissed
or added or no longer offered from the remote device).  A removed
entry without a ``deviceID`` attribute means that the folder is no
longer pending for any device.
