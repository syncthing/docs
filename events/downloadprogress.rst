-  ``Total`` - total number of blocks in the file
-  ``Pulling`` - number of blocks currently being downloaded
-  ``CopiedFromOrigin`` - number of blocks copied from the file we are
   about to replace
-  ``Reused`` - number of blocks reused from a previous temporary file
-  ``CopiedFromElsewhere`` - number of blocks copied from other files or
   potentially other folders
-  ``Pulled`` - number of blocks actually downloaded so far
-  ``BytesTotal`` - approximate total file size
-  ``BytesDone`` - approximate number of bytes already handled (already
   reused, copied or pulled)

Where block size is 128KB.

Files/folders appearing in the event data imply that the download has
been started for that file/folder, where disappearing implies that the
downloads have been finished or failed for that file/folder. There is
always a last event emitted with no data, which implies all downloads
have finished/failed.
