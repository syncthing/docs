GET /rest/db/completion
=======================

Returns the completion percentage (0 to 100) and byte / item counts. Takes
optional ``device`` and ``folder`` parameters:

- ``folder`` specifies the folder ID to calculate completion for. An empty
  or absent ``folder`` parameter means all folders as an aggregate.

- ``device`` specifies the device ID to calculate completion for. An empty
  or absent ``device`` parameter means the local device.

If a device is specified but no folder, completion is calculated for all
folders shared with that device.
