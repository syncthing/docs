GET /rest/system/browse
=======================

Returns a list of directories matching the path given by the optional parameter
``current``. The path can use `patterns as described in Go's filepath package
<https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Match>`_. A '*' will always be appended
to the given path (e.g. ``/tmp/`` matches all its subdirectories). If the option
``current`` is not given, filesystem root paths are returned.
